# Ordering RTLinux machine from JAF International Inc. #

Since Superlogics has stopped manufacturing the SL-3U-CL-IQ965-GA machine, we are now buying RTLinux machines from [JAF International Inc](http://www.rackmountnet.com). Upon our request, JAF has agreed to build a custom-made machine to suit our RTFSM needs. These machines can be identified by JAF through the model number (created specifically for us): **JAF-PU-3U01** or if necessary by sending them the [condensed purchasing quote](http://rt-fsm.googlecode.com/files/Quote%23%2020110333.pdf). Since these machines are custom-made for us, you might not be able to find the model number **JAF-PU-3U01** listed on their [website](http://www.rackmountnet.com).


# Details #

1. Download this [condensed purchasing quote](http://rt-fsm.googlecode.com/files/Quote%23%2020110333.pdf) that [JAF](http://www.rackmountnet.com) made for buying new RTLinux machines.

2. Send an email to David Huang ([mailto:david@jafint.com](mailto:david@jafint.com)) with the item code (JAF-PU-3U01) and the quantity you would like to purchase. Attach the [condensed purchasing quote](http://rt-fsm.googlecode.com/files/Quote%23%2020110333.pdf) if you feel necessary (like for e.g. David Huang might not be available).

3. For more details on the complete configuration of the machine, download this [detailed purchasing quote](http://rt-fsm.googlecode.com/files/Quote%23%2020110367.pdf).

4. This machine works fine with the current RTFSM software. There is no change in the software installation [procedure](http://rt-fsm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/INSTALL_STEP_BY_STEP.txt).

5. This machine uses the **[MB898F](http://www.ibase.com.tw/mb898.htm)** motherboard (manufactured by [iBase Technology Inc.](http://www.ibase.com.tw/index.htm) and is supposedly supported till the end of 2013 according to them) which is the key component for compatibility with Fedora 9 & our own RTFSM. Keeping the motherboard constant, feel free to re-configure other parts (like CPU, RAM etc.) according to your choice.

6. The **[MB898F](http://www.ibase.com.tw/mb898.htm)** motherboard uses integrated video built on to Intel's Q965 north bridge and Intel's 82566DC Gigabit Ethernet Controller built on to its ICH8 south bridge. Both these are compatible with Fedora 9.
